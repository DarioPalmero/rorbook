Setup

***
Facebook
***
This app is configured to run with the Facebook App "RoRBook". You should acess to it if you
are working on the project.

***
Rails Application
***

The rails app is configured to run at http://rorbook.milabs.org:3003 

* rorbook.milabs.org is configured to run at 127.0.0.1, but you could put it to
wherever you wanted in your hosts file
* I set it up on 3003 so hopefully it won't interrupt other things you have running.
